			<p style="border: 1.5px dotted blue">
				Facebook has started testing use of Aadhaar as an example to encourage new users in India to use their real names on its site. The latest move is aimed at curbing the number of fake accounts on the social media platform that has over 241 million users in the country, making India the second largest market for Facebook after the US.
<br>
				Facebook's mobile site is testing the 'name as per Aadhaar' prompt when users create a new account. "What's your name? Using the name on your Aadhaar card makes it easier for friends to recognise you," the prompt reads. The testing was first spotted by users on Reddit and Twitter. Notably, not everyone can see this prompt when creating a new account via the Facebook mobile site. We weren't able to reproduce the prompt.

					A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Gadgets 360, "We want to make sure people can use the names they're known by on Facebook, and can easily connect with friends and family. This is a small test where we provide additional language when people sign up for an account to say that using the name on their Aadhaar card makes it easier for friends to recognise them. This is an optional prompt which we are testing, people are not required to enter the name on their Aadhaar card."

			<p style="border: 1.5px dotted indigo">

    			Apple’s legal battle with Qualcomm is seemingly getting crazier with each passing week. With billions of dollars in royalties on the line, Apple is reportedly interested in dropping Qualcomm as a supply partner altogether. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has not only accused Apple of sharing its proprietary code with Intel, but has also brought motions in front of the ITC as part of an effort to prevent Apple from importing iPhones into the United States. More recently, a judge slapped Apple with a fine for withholding documents it was required to hand over to Qualcomm.
<br>
				While it’s possible that the two tech giants will ultimately reach a settlement of some sort — though both companies have shown no inclination to even budge an inch thus far — a more interesting question is how the lawsuit might impact how Apple sources components for future iPhone models. Indeed, there have been rumblings that Apple is exploring the possibility of designing iOS devices that incorporate Intel chips as opposed to those from Qualcomm.

			<p style="border: 1.5px dotted green ">WhatsApp received a legal notice from a Delhi-based advocate on Tuesday over the "middle finger" emoji on its platform. The lawyer has asked WhatsApp to remove the said emoji in less than 15 days from the messaging app, and that he will file civil or criminal cases against the company if it is not removed. He says the the middle finger emoji on WhatsApp is an obscene and lewd gesture - which is an offence in India. 
<br>
			In the notice, the advocate said: "...showing the middle finger is not only offensive but a highly belligerent, invasive, obscene, lewd gesture."
<br>
			"As per the Indian Penal Code Sections 354 and 509, it is an offence to show obscene, lewd, offensive gestures to females. Use of a lewd, offensive, obscene gesture by anyone is hereby illegal also as aforesaid. As per section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 showing of the middle finger is also an offence in Ireland," Gurmeet Singh stated in his notice.
<br>
			"By offering to use middle finger emoji in your app, you (WhatsApp) are directly abetting the use of offensive, lewd, obscene gesture," the notice said.
